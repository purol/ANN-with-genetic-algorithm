# ANN-with-genetic-algorithm
It is ANN(artificial neural network) with genetic algorithm. Each AI can learn how to find their forage.

You can build it by Visual Studio 2015 (different version can cause some problem.)
or you can just run opencvtest\x64\Release\opencvtest.exe

used library : opencv

reference : https://home.fnal.gov/~souvik/Brain/index.html
the program of regerence link looks so similar with mine. However, it is just derived from same graphic library.(opencv)
The codes are absolutely different! Actually I had not learned c++.

============================================================

How to use

1. build the project or run opencvtest.exe
2. If it is first time to run it, then type 1 and press enter button. If you want to load save file, type 2 and press enter button.
3. Watch movment of AIs. If all of them are died, the program will be closed automatically and make save file.
4. If you want to train AIs more, re-run the program and load the save file.
